	            end walk
              s run

         or

4. please keep track of when you take off the sensor

	[Original File Path] [Formatted Annotation File Path]
2. To split the file by hour and store them in separate folders of sensor dataL
	[Original File Path] [Formatted Annotation File Path] split
